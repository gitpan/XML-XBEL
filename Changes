# Changes for XML::XBEL

1.1	  Thu Jun 24, 2004

	  - Added 'recursive' flag for 'bookmarks', 'folders' and
	    'alias' methods (as defined in XML::XBEL::container)

	    (this change is not backwards compatible with XML::XBEL
	     1.0 where the 'recursive' flag was true by default.)

	  - Updated POD

1.0	  Wed Jun 23, 2004

	  - Initial public release
