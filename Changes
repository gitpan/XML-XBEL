	  - Fixed MANIFEST (RT ticket 12027)

1.3	  Sat Mar 26, 2005

	  - POD fix (RT ticket 11608)

	  - Replace Data::Denter w/ Data::Dumper in t/50.xbel
	    and commented it out since it serves no real purpose
	    beyond debugging (RT ticket 9269)

	  - Replace ExtUtils::MakeMaker with Module::Build

1.2	  Sat Jul 03, 2004

	  - Added 'toSAX' method to XML::XBEL.pm

	  - Added 'recursive' flag for 'bookmarks', 'folders' and
	    'alias' methods (as defined in XML::XBEL::container)

	    (this change is not backwards compatible with XML::XBEL
	     1.0 where the 'recursive' flag was true by default.)

	  - Updated POD

	  - Initial public release
